# Getting-a-better-understanding-of-Verilog
This is just a repo to contain every verilog module I make for the Spartan 6 as I get a better understanding of how to do more involved projects with FPGA's

Note: at the momment some of the code is from alchitry.com which I added comments to. 

I'm currently following their tutorial on how to use the FPGA as an external processor to another device.
